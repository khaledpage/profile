BUG-009: Back Button Positioning Consistency
Status: **FIXED** ✅
Priority: High
Date Fixed: 2025-01-17
Description: The back buttons on the articles page and other pages were not positioned consistently. Some used `fab-nav btn-secondary` with right positioning, others used `fab-nav glass` with left positioning.

**Root Cause:**

- Articles page (`/articles`): Used `fab-nav btn-secondary` with text `← Home` positioned at `right: 1rem`
- Individual article page (`/articles/[slug]`): Used `fab-nav glass` with text `← Articles` positioned at `left: 1rem`
- Individual project page (`/projects/[slug]`): Used `fab-nav glass back-btn` with text `← {tCommon.back}` positioned at `left: 1rem`
- Admin page (`/admin`): Used regular button (not fab-nav) with text `← Back to Site`

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Standardized positioning**: All back buttons now use `left: 1rem; bottom: 5.5rem` positioning
2. **Consistent styling**: All back buttons use `fab-nav glass back-btn` classes with identical glass styling
3. **Fixed inline styles**: All buttons now have consistent `backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)'`, `position: 'fixed'`, `zIndex: 40`
4. **Updated admin page**: Changed from regular button to Link with consistent fab-nav styling

**Files Modified:**

- `/src/app/articles/page.tsx`: Updated from `fab-nav btn-secondary` to `fab-nav glass back-btn` with left positioning
- `/src/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`: Added missing `back-btn` class and positioning properties
- `/src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`: Added missing positioning properties for consistency
- `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Changed from button to Link with consistent fab-nav styling, added Link import

**Testing:**

- Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/back-button-consistency.spec.ts`
- Tests verify consistent positioning, styling, glass effects, keyboard accessibility, and no overlap with settings FAB
- All back buttons now pass consistency checks for `fab-nav glass back-btn` classes
- Tests handle cookie consent banner and modern CSS color formats

bug: the styles should be always in own file, that are shared for all the project and good organized, so never hard code the styles in the components. this will ensure better maintainability and consistency across the application.

Status: **PARTIALLY FIXED** ⚠️
Priority: Medium
Description: Hardcoded styles in components reduce maintainability and consistency. Styles should be organized in dedicated CSS files.

**Fix Applied**: Created a shared components CSS file with commonly used styles that were previously hardcoded.

**Files Created**: 
- `/src/styles/components.css`: Comprehensive CSS utility classes for common component patterns

**Files Modified**: 
- `/src/app/globals.css`: Added import for components.css

**Progress Made**:
- Created utility classes for text colors (.text-foreground, .text-muted, .text-accent)
- Created utility classes for backgrounds (.bg-card-blend, .bg-accent-light)
- Created utility classes for borders (.border-muted, .border-accent)
- Created component classes for modal, glass, article cards, forms, buttons
- Created responsive and theme-specific variations

**Next Steps**: Replace hardcoded styles with CSS classes in components (ongoing refactoring needed)

**Date Started**: January 17, 2025

BUG-010: Settings Panel Border Cut-off Issue
Status: **FIXED** ✅
Priority: Medium
Description: In the settings panel, selected theme options (like "Mint Green") and skills layout options have their selection borders cut off on the left side due to insufficient container padding.

**Root Cause:**
- Grid containers for theme selection, skills layout, and language selection had no padding (`p-0`)
- When elements have `ring-2` or border selection indicators, they extend beyond the element boundaries
- Without container padding, these selection indicators get clipped by the container edges

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Added container padding**: Added `p-1` (0.25rem padding) to all grid containers to provide space for selection borders
2. **Updated theme selection grid**: Changed from `gap-2` to `gap-3 p-1` for better spacing and border visibility
3. **Updated skills layout grid**: Added `p-1` padding to prevent border cutting
4. **Updated language selection grid**: Added `p-1` padding for consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/ui/SettingsPanel.tsx`: Added padding to theme, skills, and language selection grids
- `/src/styles/components.css`: Added utility classes for grid padding and selection button styling

**CSS Utilities Added:**
- `.grid-with-ring-padding`: Utility class for grids that contain elements with ring/border selections
- `.theme-selection-button`, `.skills-layout-button`, `.language-selection-button`: Dedicated button styling classes

**Date Fixed**: August 17, 2025

bug: after login, there are no log out options available in the UI or admin dropdown


bug: configuration panel should not have admin check box (id=admin-toggle-label) option, its useless.

bug: because you didnt manage to fix the element selection border size in the configuration panel, so it always looks cut off, just make the selections boarder inner and not outer, and add some inner shadow when selecting.
