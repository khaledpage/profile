 you tried many time to fix this bugs, but you faild each time, maybe this time you can fix it:

[FIXED - 16.08.2025] Articles horizontal scroll now shows ALL published articles (5 total) in chronological order (old to new). Fixed the logic that was filtering out featured articles from the scroll section. The scroll now matches the count on /articles page.
user: i confierm that

[FIXED - 16.08.2025] Both "Let's Talk" buttons (desktop and mobile) now have prominent wave-ring animations that continuously create ripple effects to draw attention. Enhanced the animation timing and visibility.
user: Enhanced animation further with stronger box-shadow effects, z-index fix, and more prominent ripple patterns using accent-1 and accent-2 colors.

[FIXED - 16.08.2025] Font color theme issues in articles-view-all-button and other components fixed. Replaced hardcoded accent colors and gray text with proper theme variables (var(--foreground), var(--muted)) for better contrast and theme consistency.
