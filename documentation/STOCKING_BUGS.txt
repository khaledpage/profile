 you tried many time to fix this bugs, but you faild each time, maybe this time you can fix it:

- The articles section in home id= articles-scroll-container, where the animated row is, the row is not scrolling with all available article, it should list them all in this row and sort them from old to new, and robost againt bugs or error, so it should have fall back. it has a bug becuase it dont show the same number of article found in http://localhost:3000/articles

- the btn header-cta-button has no animation as requierd that drow attention  like waves or ringing. Info there are 2 lets talk button, both of them should have same rquierment.
