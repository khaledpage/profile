Build me a **personal portfolio website with Next.js** that presents me as a professional developer.

### Requirements

1. **Content Source**

   * Use a `config.json` file to define all website content (text, headings, links, contact info, etc.).
   * The same `config.json` should allow selecting the active theme.

2. **Design & Themes**

   * Provide multiple **color themes** (at least: dark, gray, white, mid-white, white-10, white-20, and 10–20 additional creative color palettes).
   * The theme should be switchable by setting it in `config.json`.
   * Make the design **fancy, modern, professional, and flexible**, with subtle animations and transitions.
   * Ensure the website is fully **responsive** and works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.

3. **Content Sections**

   * **Hero section**: Display my name, role (developer), one professional tagline, and a call-to-action button (e.g., “Work with me” or “Contact me”).
   * **About section**: Show my **photo** and include text pulled from my **PDF file of experience**.
   * **Experience/Portfolio section**: List my skills, projects, or highlights (from `config.json`).
   * **Motivation section**: Include engaging text and animations that encourage customers to contact me or work with me.
   * **Process section**: A visually appealing flow (with icons or illustrations) showing how I can **convert an idea into a project**. Example steps:

     * Concept → Analysis → Design → Development → Delivery → Support.
   * **Contact section**: Contact form or button to reach me.

4. **Additional Features**

   * Allow multiple **layout styles or themes** (e.g., minimal, modern, creative).
   * Make sure animations are elegant, not distracting, and used to guide user attention.
   * Provide a **well-structured Next.js project** with clear file organization.
   * All texts, images, and theme selections must be configurable from `config.json`.

### Deliverables

* A fully working Next.js website.
* `config.json` with:

  * Content (text, links, PDF reference, image path).
  * Theme selection.
* Multiple themes and layouts built-in.
